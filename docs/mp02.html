<section id="award-title-greenest-transit-agency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="award-title-greenest-transit-agency"><strong>Award Title :</strong> Greenest Transit Agency</h4>
<p><strong>Short description of the metric</strong><br>
To find the greenest agency, we looked at how much CO₂ is released for every mile a person travels. The lower the emissions per mile, the cleaner and more eco-friendly the service is.</p>
<p><strong>Name of the winning agency + value</strong><br>
The winner is Susquehanna Regional Transportation Authority, dba: rabbittransit, with only&nbsp;<strong>0.000094 lbs CO₂ per passenger mile</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Reference value for context</strong></p>
<p>In comparison, the typical agency produces about 0.00142 lbs of CO₂ per mile, which means rabbittransit is nearly 15 times more efficient than average.</p>
</section>
<section id="award-title-most-emissions-avoided" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="award-title-most-emissions-avoided"><strong>Award Title :</strong> Most Emissions Avoided</h4>
<p><strong>Short description of the metric</strong><br>
To determine which agency made the biggest impact in reducing emissions, we calculated how much CO₂ would have been produced if all passengers had used personal vehicles instead. We then compared that to the agency’s actual transit emissions to find how much pollution was avoided.</p>
<p><strong>Name of the winning agency + value</strong><br>
The winner is&nbsp;<strong>MTA New York City Transit</strong>, which avoided approximately&nbsp;<strong>8.54 billion lbs of CO₂</strong>&nbsp;by providing efficient public transit instead of individual car trips.</p>
<p><strong>Reference value for context</strong><br>
This number stands out dramatically compared to other agencies, thanks to the MTA’s large ridership and high reliance on lower-emission rail systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="award-title-most-multi-modal-agency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="award-title-most-multi-modal-agency"><strong>Award Title :</strong> Most Multi-Modal Agency</h4>
<p><strong>Short description of the metric</strong><br>
To determine the most multi-modal agency, we looked at how many different types of transit each agency runs—like buses, rail, or ferries. Agencies offering more modes typically provide more comprehensive service to a wider range of riders.</p>
<p><strong>Name of the winning agency + value</strong><br>
New Jersey Transit Corporation took the lead, operating six different transit modes. That variety reflects their strong commitment to providing flexible and accessible transportation options.</p>
<p><strong>Reference value for context</strong><br>
Since most agencies only run one or two modes, NJ Transit stands out as one of the most diverse and adaptable transit providers in the country.</p>
</section>
<section id="award-title-least-efficient-transit-agency" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="award-title-least-efficient-transit-agency"><strong>Award Title :</strong> Least Efficient Transit Agency</h4>
<p><strong>Short description of the metric</strong><br>
To determine which agency was the least efficient, we compared total CO₂ emissions to ridership numbers. Specifically, we calculated how many pounds of CO₂ were emitted for each individual passenger trip. The higher the number, the more inefficient the agency.</p>
<p><strong>Name of the winning agency + value</strong><br>
The Alaska Railroad Corporation stood out with an inefficiency score of <strong>319.99</strong>, meaning it emits nearly <strong>320 pounds of CO₂</strong> for every rider it serves.</p>
<p><strong>Reference value for context</strong></p>
<p>For context, the median transit agency emits <strong>less than 3 pounds</strong> of CO₂ per trip, making Alaska Railroad significantly less efficient than its peers.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mini Project 2 offered a detailed look into how transit agencies across the U.S. perform in terms of energy use, emissions, and operational efficiency. From identifying the greenest agency with the lowest emissions per passenger mile to recognizing those with the highest emissions avoided, the analysis revealed significant variation in environmental impact. I also highlighted agencies leading in electrification and multi-modal operations, while calling attention to those with inefficient practices. These findings not only highlight success stories but also point to opportunities for improvement in building a more sustainable transit future.</p>
